# BioHub

This is just another frontend to the features provided by ZenHub for GitHub. It aims to be more neatly arranged and fixes some non-available features.

## Getting Started

If you just want to deploy this to your server, download the [latest release](https://github.com/biolauri/bioHub/releases) (the *biohub.tar.gz* file) and jump to [Deploy to server](#deploy-to-server).

Otherwise, clone this repository and run `npm install` within it. Make sure to have [node.js and npm installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (at least versions 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x).

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Useing in product√≠on

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Deploy to server

TODO: Explain the deployment process.

## Running the tests

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). It defaults to Chrome as the tests run much faster. If you need another browser, adjust the corresponding package.json script.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Contributing

Just [open an issue](https://github.com/biolauri/bioHub/issues/new) or fork the repository and make a pull request. It's so darn easy. ;-)
